## Stakeholder

<div align='center'>

Based in New York City, **CityBridge** oversees and operates the LinkNYC program and its 5G expansion introduced in 2022. The consortium is a partnership between **Intersection**, a media technology firm, and **Boldyn Networks**, a company specializing in wireless infrastructure.

Since 2014, CityBridge has worked with the city to build what has become the world’s most extensive free public Wi-Fi network, designed to bring fast, reliable, and equitable internet access to communities throughout all five boroughs.

## Business Problem

<div align='center'>

Since its inception, LinkNYC has sought to close inequities amongst NYC communities by providing high-speed internet access at no cost to residents. To ensure this access is provided fairly and ethically, CityBridge has asked us to explore what's working and areas of improvement.

Our team had several factors that we wanted to explore, including kiosk availability in the five boroughs, usage patterns among residents, and energy consumption through bandwidth and upload/download data. Our aim was to provide an insightful report on key metrics that could aid consortium decisions and contributions.

Thus, we arrived to our overall question: 

**How can LinkNYC optimize kiosk availability and usage efficiency across boroughs while minimizing energy waste?**
